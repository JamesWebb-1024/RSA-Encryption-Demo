# RSA-Encryption-Demo

This program is a demonstration of RSA Encryption. NOTE: You may need to install the mod package for the program to work.

When running the program a window will open with options to open 3 new windows; Key Generation, Encryption and Decryption.
Within Key generation you will have the option to generate a key. Upon pressing the button this will be printed into the terminal, where it can be copied into the relevant boxes in the encryption and decryption windows.
